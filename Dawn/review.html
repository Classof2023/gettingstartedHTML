<h1 id ="relative"> My Role Model: My Mother and who is the biggest influencer in my life.


<p> The reason I chose my mother as my role model is because she is the woman that literally gave me life. Mo mom is living proof that you can rise up above adversity and challenges. I love her so much and even though she isnt the best cook, she still provides in her best way and i love her for that. She is the true example of a role model and strong person. </p>
