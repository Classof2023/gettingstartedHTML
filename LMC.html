<h1> Lose My Cool ft. Redman </h1>

<p> Lose My Cool ft. Redman is the 3rd track on the "Release Some Tension" album and it was also the 3rd track of that album and was the 3rd single on that album but only was #31 on the US R&B charts. My favorite lyrics are, "I lose my cool whenever your around, I cant help myself". </p>
