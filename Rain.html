<h1> Rain </h1>

<p> Rain is the 1st song on the album "Release Some Tension" that didn't have a rapper and was the last single of this album and was released as a sinlge on March 9, 1998 and was #25 on the US charts. My favorite lyrics are, "rain down on me let your love fall like raindrops". </p>
