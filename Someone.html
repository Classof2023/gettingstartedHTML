<h1> Someone ft. Puff Daddy

<p> Someone ft. Puff Daddy is the 1st track on the SWV Album, "Release Some Tension" and it was the 2nd of that album to be a single on July 30, 1997 and only reached #19 on the US charts and #5 on the US R&B charts. My favorite lyrics of the song are, "you could be the one love of a lifetime".</p>
